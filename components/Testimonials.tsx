I needn't have worried at all. The chimney breast was left in a better state than when the guys started and they took great care not to risk any damage to the fireplace. Not a scratch! High quality work and good craic into the bargain! Thanks chaps. Would definitely recommend. Will also be using their new flue cleaning service to ensure it's maintained properly. All the best.

      quote: 'Last week I had 3 chimney pots replaced and appropriate cowels fitted on 3 separate chimney stacks, together with associated pointing and replacement coping. I cannot speak too highly of the manner in which Tommy and his two colleagues carried out this work. They were meticulous in their care in working on my Rosemary-tiled roof. I consider them to be honest, efficient, clean and totally professional. They also engender confidence in their knowledge, skill and ability. If you are looking for someone to carry out this type of work - look no further!!',

      quote: 'Firenstack Solutions have just finished fitting my new multi-fuel stove in my house. Having meet a few guys, who called around after 6 to suit me, and recieved a few estimates my gut instinct was to hire this team to complete the work and I was not disappointed. They visited my property before I bought the stove and was able to advise me and exactly what I needed for the job. From the spec of the flue down to any accessories I may need to complete the job, each of which they could supply. One of the things that I was concerned about was the lintel. My father in law has a stove fitted and the fitter, NOT Firenstack, used concrete plaster board which after 6 months started to warp. All in all a great service fitting flue, stove, slate hearth and plastering to a very high standard. All in all we saved over Â£1000 by using this fitter.',
